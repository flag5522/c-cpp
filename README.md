Graph Search Algorithms: The first code implements Depth-First Search (DFS) and Iterative Deepening Search (IDS) on a graph represented as an adjacency list. It models a simplified map of Romania to demonstrate pathfinding from a given start node to a goal node, including calculating path costs.

First Choice Hill Climbing and Random Restart Hill Climbing optimization techniques: The second code demonstrates First Choice Hill Climbing and Random Restart Hill Climbing optimization techniques. It targets minimizing a complex objective function with multiple local minima. The code allows for user-defined starting points, step sizes, number of restarts, and iterations, providing a practical application of these optimization methods to identify optimal solutions in a challenging landscape.

Both codes are educational tools for understanding and implementing basic algorithms in graph search and optimization, showcasing C++ programming capabilities in solving algorithmic problems.
